## Overview

Interactive UI component, reflexive using Flexbox and Javascript for the interactions. I'd very much appreciate any tips and ideas to make it better or in a more eficient way. Thank you!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Using Javascript to show/hide parts of the UI.

### Continued development

I feel like I need a lot of practice with those UI elements (they still take me lomg time), and I appreciate tips and learning better ways of doing it.

### Useful resources

- Stackoverflow, for the event listeners.
